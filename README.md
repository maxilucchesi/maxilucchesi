# Hi there! I'm Maxi üëã

I love analyzing data and finding valuable insights to make important decisions. üìä I have skills in Python, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, GCP, GitHub for project management, and machine learning. I'm also an AI enthusiast, always eager to learn and apply new techniques. ü§ñ

Currently, I work in fraud prevention in the Fintech division of Mercado Libre, handling process design and documentation. üõ°Ô∏è Before this, I was an external auditor at PwC, where I worked with client data to audit IT and business processes, performing data reprocessing and creating visualizations across various industries. üìà

I have strong leadership skills, business vision, and creativity, along with assertive communication and public speaking abilities. My agile, analytical, and self-taught mindset helps me succeed in dynamic environments. With fluency in English, I excel at sharing complex information clearly and effectively. üåê
